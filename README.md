WORK IN PROGRESS

Silly 2 player game heavily inspired by [Reiner Knizia's Lost Cities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Cities).  For now, it's just a playground for me to try new out some new stuff.

A rough draft of the rules is available [here](https://github.com/brianstarke/venturecricket/wiki/Rules)
